About the project

The goal of this project is to simplify the management of projects, clients, users (employees) and their tasks. I imagined it in a way that the owner can monitor the condition of all his clients, previous cooperation and achieved goals with the client.
There are also users or employees who work for a particular company, and the owner will be able to monitor their work and progress through the tasks assigned to them.

*About technologies*

The technologies I used are:
MySQL - as a database for storing all data used by the application.
Express.js - Framework for Node.js
React.js - for the frontend part of the application along with its third party libraries.
Node.js - For the backend part of the application together with libraries like (Session, Cookies, MySQL, Cors, etc.)

Short note:
I worked on this project so that I could present to future employers my knowledge and skills I have gained through my previous work experience and show my way of thinking and my approach to problem solving.
