## About the project

The goal of this project is to simplify the management of projects, clients, users (employees) and their tasks. I imagined it in a way that the owner can monitor the condition of all his clients, previous cooperation and achieved goals with the client.
There are also users or employees who work for a particular company, and the owner will be able to monitor their work and progress through the tasks assigned to them.
